# 🚀 Quick Start Guide - TuneMatch PWA

## For VS Code Development (No Android Studio Needed!)

### Step 1: Prerequisites
```bash
# Make sure you have Node.js installed (v16 or higher)
node --version

# If not installed, download from: https://nodejs.org
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies
```bash
# Open terminal in VS Code (Ctrl + `)
npm install
```

### Step 3: Start Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

Your app will open at `http://localhost:5173` (or similar)

### Step 4: Test PWA Features

#### In Chrome/Edge DevTools:
1. Press `F12` to open DevTools
2. Go to **Application** tab
3. Check **Service Workers** → Should show "activated and running"
4. Check **Manifest** → Should show app info and icons
5. Test offline:
   - Check "Offline" checkbox in Network tab
   - Reload page → Should still work!

### Step 5: Test Install Prompt
1. Wait 3 seconds after page loads
2. You'll see a beautiful install banner at the bottom
3. Click "Install" to add to your device

**Note:** Install prompt only shows:
- On HTTPS (or localhost)
- If not already installed
- On supported browsers (Chrome, Edge, Samsung Internet)

## 📱 Test on Your Phone

### Method 1: Using Ngrok (Easiest)
```bash
# Install ngrok
npm install -g ngrok

# In one terminal, start your app
npm run dev

# In another terminal, expose it
ngrok http 5173
```

Copy the HTTPS URL (e.g., `https://abc123.ngrok.io`) and open on your phone!

### Method 2: Same WiFi Network
```bash
# Start dev server with network access
npm run dev -- --host
```

Find your local IP (e.g., `192.168.1.100`) and visit `http://192.168.1.100:5173` on your phone.

**⚠️ Important:** PWA features (service worker, install) only work on HTTPS or localhost!

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Test on real devices** - Emulators don't show the full PWA experience
2. **Use HTTPS always** - PWA features require it
3. **Keep service worker simple** - Complex logic = more bugs
4. **Monitor console logs** - Look for `[PWA]` messages
5. **Update regularly** - Service worker updates automatically
6. **Cache strategically** - Don't cache everything
7. **Test offline mode** - Students might have poor connectivity
