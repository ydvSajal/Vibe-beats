## 🚀 How It Works (Backend)

### Data Flow
```
User Action → Frontend (React) → API Call → Backend (Hono) → Database (KV Store)
                                                    ↓
                                            Response → Frontend → UI Update
```

### Storage Strategy
- **KV Store**: User profiles, matches, messages
- **localStorage**: Auth tokens, dark mode, preferences
- **Service Worker Cache**: Static assets, offline support

### API Endpoints
- `/auth/*` - Authentication (signup, signin, verify)
- `/profile/*` - Profile management (create, update, get)
- `/matches/*` - Swipe and match logic (potential, swipe, matches)
- `/messages/*` - Messaging (conversations, messages, send)
